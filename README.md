# lite-xl IDE

![lite-xl IDE with Debugger Open](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lite-xl/lite-xl-ide/main/screenshots/debugger.png)

[`lite-xl`](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl) is a light-weight extensible text editor.

`lite-xl-ide` aims to be a suite of plugins for `lite-xl` that can turn it into a high-performance C/C++ IDE with minimal fuss.

Please note, `lite-xl-ide` is still **experimental**; it is not ready for release. Use at your own risk.

## Quickstart

To install, you can use [`lpm`](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl-plugin-manager):

```bash
lpm add https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl-ide.git && lpm install ide --no-install-optional
```

If you want to just try it out, you can always use `run` to try it in a new lite bottle:

```bash
lpm run https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl-ide.git:main ide --no-install-optional
```

Alternatively, if you don't have `lpm`, or don't want it, you can always pull the repository manually with `git`
and simply copy the entire set of plugins into lite's plugin directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl-ide.git && cp -R lite-xl-ide/plugins/* ~/.config/lite-xl/plugins
```

By default, `ide` should try and figure out what your build system is and activate the appropriate build system module.
However, in many cases, the build system cannot infer your build targets, so you'll want to manually set them up,
as specified below in the [build targets](#build-targets) section.

## Plugins

### Build

The build plugin is a flexible build system. It can be configured to either use `make`, or, it can take over entirely
and run all the compile commands directly.

* Support for `make`, `cmake`, `meson`, a shell command, or the default internal build system.
* Support for internal building if configured with an appropriate compiler frontend. (`gcc` or `clang`).
* Support for executing binary in an external terminal.

#### Build Targets

To explicitly use a specific build system with a set of build targets, you should place the configuration for these modules in your
[lite-xl project module](https://lite-xl.com/user-guide/configuration/#project-module), which can be opened with `Core: Open Project Module`.

When adding build targets, they broadly look like this:

```lua
config.plugins.build.targets = {
	{ name = "debug", binary = "bin/debug-binary" },
	{ name = "release", binary = "bin/release-binary" }
}
```

This will set up two build targets, which can be toggled between with `ctrl+t`.

Each build system will allow for different arguments, but the two most important are `name` and `binary` (if applicable).

##### make

To explicitly use a makefile with a set of build targets, you should put the following in your lite-xl project module. 

```lua
config.plugins.build.targets = {
	{ name = "debug", binary = "bin/debug-binary" },
	{ name = "release", binary = "bin/release-binary" }
}
config.plugins.build.type = "make"
```

##### cmake

To explicitly use a CMakeLists file, with a set of build targets, you should put the following in your lite-xl project module.

```lua
config.plugins.build.targets = {
	{ name = "debug", buildtype = "debug", binary = "bin/debug-binary" },
	{ name = "release", buildtype = "release", binary = "bin/release-binary" }
}
config.plugins.build.type = "cmake"
```

##### meson

To explicitly use a meson.build file, with a set of build targets, you should put the following in your lite-xl project module.

```lua
config.plugins.build.targets = {
	{ name = "debug", buildtype = "debug", binary = "bin/debug-binary" },
	{ name = "release", buildtype = "release", binary = "bin/release-binary" }
}
config.plugins.build.type = "meson"
```

##### internal

The internal build system allows you to set a source directory, compiler flags, a compiler, a linker, etc.. for a C/C++ project.

```lua
config.plugins.build.targets = {
	{ name = "debug", binary = "bin/debug-binary", type = "executable", src = "src" },
	{ name = "release", binary = "bin/release-binary", type = "executable", src = "src" }
}
config.plugins.build.type = "internal"
```

* `type`: is your type of build; valid values are `executable`, `static` or `shared`.
* `ignored_files`: will ignore any file that matches the pattern based on the normal ignore syntax.
* `files`: will take specific files and add them to the compile with override options based on any of these other options
* `cflags`: will specify compile time flags.
* `ldflags`: will specify link time flags
* `cc`: will specify your c compiler
* `cxx`: will specify your c++ compiler
* `ar`: specifies your archiver
* `ld`: specifies your linker

##### shell

The shell build system lets you specify a custom command, which will run upon building.

```lua
config.plugins.build.targets = {
	{ name = "debug", binary = "bin/debug-binary", command = "make", arguments = { "debug" } },
	{ name = "release", binary = "bin/release-binary", command = "make", arguments = { "release" } }
}
config.plugins.build.type = "shell"
```


### Debugger

The debugger plugin acts as a front-end to `gdb`.

* Allows placing of breakpoints by clicking in the gutter.
* Allows all normal debugging control operations: step, step over, step up, continue, break, quit.
* Allows watching variables by hovering over the appropriate symbol during debugging.
* Allows traversing the callstack when stopped.
* Allow to run debugged program with shell-like argument list.
* Allows watching variables by adding them to a watchlist.
* Allow clicking on the debugger status to change it (running -> break, inactive -> start, stopped -> continue).
* Allows binding the debugger plugin to `terminal`, allowing it to automatically parse and emit input to the debugger in a particular terminal.

#### TODO

* Allows adding hovered watched to watchlist with right click context menu.

### LSP

Full support for LSP through @jgmdev's [wonderful plugin](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl-lsp), included in this manifest.

#### TODO

* Bundle a statically compiled ccls with LSP, and configure it through the ide plugin.

### Git

Full support for git, again through @jgmdev's [VCS plugin](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl-plugins).

* Bundle a statically compiled git for vcs.
